title: Introduction
description: 'Welcome to the SofToPos API documentation! The SofToPos API is designed to assist developers in building applications that interact with NFC mobile payments. It requires a website API key to use all API endpoints. The API is built for use with a single website, You can generate the API key in the SofToPos dashboard after adding your website, and use it as a secure token to authenticate your API requests.'

## Setting up

1. To connect your SoftToPos app with your current website, you will need to obtain your website's QR code and scan it.
2. To create a payment request with total and reference, use the "/requests/create" endpoint.
3. To check the payment request status, use the "requests/get/{uuid}" endpoint. In the response, you will see if "success" or "failed" is true. If both are false, it means that the payment request is still waiting to complete in the SoftToPos mobile app.
4. To insert the transaction info into your application, listen to the webhook response from the SoftToPos API. It will return:

```json
{
    "request": {
        "id": "",
        "amount": "",
        "commission": "",
        "meta": "",
        "uuid": "",
        "paid": "",
        "success": "",
        "failed": "",
        "trx": "",
        "trx_message": "",
        "cardType": "",
        "verificationMethod": "",
        "ref": "",
        "info": ""
    }
}
```
<Info>Note: When using the webhook endpoint response to insert transaction info into your application, you must avoid man-in-the-middle attacks by verifying the request status through the "requests/get/{uuid}" endpoint. Check if the request status is "success" or "failed".</Info>
